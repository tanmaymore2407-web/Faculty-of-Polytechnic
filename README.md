# Faculty of Polytechnic — Python in 8 Weeks

A 2-month introductory Python course for diploma CS students. Designed for
absolute beginners — variables, loops, functions, collections, files,
errors — finishing with a small Polkadot-themed "tiny blockchain" capstone
implemented entirely in Python.

## How students submit work

The PR workflow is **fork + personal folder**:

1. **One-time setup:**
   - Click **Fork** at the top of this repo on github.com.
   - Inside your fork, create the folder `students/<your-firstname-lastname>/`
     (e.g. `students/shreya-deshmukh/`). This is your personal workspace for
     the whole course — you only do this once.

2. **For each lab problem:**
   - Click **"Sync fork"** on your fork's homepage to get today's new starter.
   - Open your fork in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
     (`Code → Codespaces → Create codespace`) — this is a free in-browser VS
     Code with Python already installed.
   - Create a new file inside **your own folder**:
     `students/<your-firstname-lastname>/D{NN}_{slug}.py`
     (e.g. `students/shreya-deshmukh/D04_greeter.py`).
   - Copy the day's `starter.py` into it and solve the problem.
   - Commit + push from VS Code's Source Control panel.
   - Open a Pull Request against the upstream `main` branch.

3. Faculty reviews and merges your PR.

Over 8 weeks each student accumulates ~30 files in their personal folder —
a visible portfolio on their GitHub profile.

## How faculty work

- New lab content (deck + lab folder) is built the **weekend before** each
  week so we can adjust based on what's landing in the classroom.
- Lab review during the 10:15–11:00 break: skim PRs, leave a one-line
  comment, merge when correct.
- `solutions/` (on a separate `solutions` branch, faculty-only) mirrors the
  `lab/` structure with reference solutions.

## Assessment shape

- 20% — Daily PR participation
- 25% — 5 Friday mini-projects
- 15% — 3 biweekly mini-quizzes
- 15% — Final mini-test (D39)
- 25% — Capstone Tiny Blockchain (Module 3)

No formal external exam. See `syllabus/COURSE_DESIGN.md` for the full design.
